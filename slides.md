## Weak reasons to work some place

* I get more **money** than in other places (and I am waiting for the IPO
  to give me an extra bonus and will then cash out)
* Good **work-life balance** that allows me to stay healthy/workout ... be
  a mom/dad ...
* I am having **fun** ...
* I am **learning** something ...

## Weak reasons are weak, because they are not differentiated and (easily) replicable, means you can find them (easily) somewhere else!

---

## Strong reasons to work some place

* You believe in the purpose of the endeavour
  * "I am saving the planet" ... "I am building a cathedral" ...
  * ... and this matters to me because ...
* You get an opportunity for personal growth by working for/with
  strong leaders
  * You get to do something difficult that you have never done before ...
  * ... and while you do it you get a chance to watch a blueprint in
    action

## How to make people care?

The power of asking Why? Once a month ask ...

* Why do you do what you do?
* Why does it matter?
* Why are you here?

Possible answers ...

* I don't know
* Because you told me to do it
* Because ... <insert good/magical answer here>

# Building cathedrals

## Connecting the dots 

Be prepared to ...

* ... connect the dots for the people that work with you and for you!!!
* ... to talk about the cathedral we are building and why what they do matters!!!
* ... to talk about what you do why what you do matters and explain how what they do helps you!!!

# More thoughts

## Care is key ...

Care for ...

* ... a group of people (the team that works for you or the team you are a part of)
* ... a single person (the CEO, your boss, the **one** friend you have in the company)

Care about ...

* ... a big idea (and feeling fine to share the caring with a lot of people (the cathedral))
* ... a smaller task (Building the roof. This tasks needs you. Nobody else cares about it like you do)
